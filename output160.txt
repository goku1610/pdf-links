A diversified equity portfolio that endeavours to achieve long term capital appreciation and generate returns by investing across market cap. This is a Market Cap agnostic portfolio which aims to generate superior risk adjusted return with the ability to switch between market caps and sectors based on their proprietary asset allocation model.

Benchmark agnostic sectoral exposure in companies across market caps. Portfolio seeks to generate capital appreciation over relatively “Medium to Long” term period. The idea of the portfolio is to stay above the benchmark at all times. Portfolio composition is unconstrained with respect to the Benchmark and can move across market caps as per RH’s proprietary asset allocation model. Typical Portfolio holding would not have more than 15-25 stocks keeping Nifty as Index Benchmark.

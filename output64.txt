The  investment objective of the portfolio is to invest in stocks that are primed to benefit from the catalysts and secular growth names

The core focus would be on companies that are primed to benefit from the catalysts mentioned below:

• Micro Turnaround (market share gain, new product launch etc)
• Macro / Change in business cycle
• Management Change
• Deleveraging
• Demerger
• Mid to Large Cap Potential
• Secular Growth Names

Idea is to look at stocks which have catalysts that will help unlock value over the next 2-3 years

Multi cap portfolio of approximately 15-25 stocks
To exploit the inefficiencies in the market that leads to mispricing of stocks that are fundamentally strong

Buy companies with:
• Strong Balance Sheets
• Good Capital allocation track record
• High return on capital over a longer time frame

Derivatives exposures in the portfolio will be in line with SEBI guidelines and will be taken only for hedging purposes.

We firmly believe that bottom-up, fundamental research offers the best way to identify high-quality companies with above-average, sustainable earnings growth.

• Fundamental Research:

The portfolio construction process begins with fundamental analysis performed by equity analyst(s), which provides the portfolio management team with company and industry research. Investment ideas are also developed by analysing company and industry information from meetings with the company managements, suppliers, users, competitors, industry consultants and broker research community.

• Research Process:

The equity research process typically begins with an industry/sector overview to identify industry trends and provide a framework for individual security selection. Fundamental analysis at this level usually involves analysis of unit growth prospects, pricing power, international growth opportunities, the regulatory environment, and economic sensitivity. Analyst(s) develop a robust knowledge of the economic, political and international situations that affect the industries under study.

Growth in Value

• Abakkus Asset Manager follows the ‘approach of growth in value investing’, which means, identifying those companies which are value picks in terms of its stock price versus its business earnings. Companies with traits & more potential  for growth in sales, market share and earnings.

• Abakkus Asset Manager believes that such companies have not only margin of safety because of the low investable price but also, a high scope of stock getting re-rated as the growth story becomes more visible to the market.

• Following Abakkus’ philosophy of finding growth in value may sound simple, but it is not easy and very few companies are able to do it well. Most get stuck in value and which over time becomes a deep value as if growth doesn’t follow.

Contrarian Approach

• Abakkus prefers to be a contrarian: Investing in companies, where other investors still do not have high conviction. Based on knowledge of companies growth potential, once convinced, Abakkus doesn’t hesitate investing early, as a first investor or as an only investor.

Abakkus Asset Manager LLP is an alpha focused asset manager investing in Indian Equities. Founded in 2018 by Mr. Sunil Singhania with a vision to make Abakkus, one of India’s most revered and top performing asset managers. Over the last 4 years, Abakkus has launched funds under the Category III AIF and the PMS platform. AMC today manages ~ Rs 9,000 crores of assets.

All Cap Approach portfolio is a Benchmark agnostic diversified portfolio adhering to proprietary “MEETS” investment framework. It focuses on bottom-up investment ideas with focus on stocks which can double their earnings in next 4-5 years. Portfolio typically will have 35-50% allocation towards large caps and rest is in broader markets. Typically, focus area of the portfolio in broader market is in companies that are between Rs 5,000 crs to Rs 35,000 crs range.

Portfolio looks at decent earnings growth of atleast mid-teens, while not overpaying in terms of valuations. Owing to this, typically you will not find the richly valued quality or over-hyped names in the portfolio as most of these names trade at an significant premium to market levels and are priced to perfection.

Within large cap our focus is on investing in companies with earnings visibility and slightly contrarian to industry peers while our mid cap exposure is typically into companies which are 2nd or 3rd player but known player in their segment of operations and that have sustainable business with over 15% ROEs.

Those investors seeking for differentiated portfolio can invest in this strategy with horizon of 4-5 years. Portfolio has a blend of large caps to focus on stability during volatile times as well as decent broader market exposure to focus on alpha generation. The portfolio manager’s endeavour is to invest judicially rather than just by allocation basis which has helped in generating risk adjusted returns in the past.

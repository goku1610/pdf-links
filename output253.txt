Fund aims to compound wealth by identifying high growth good quality companies

At Carnelian, we believe in growth investing at reasonable valuations & obsess about the risk-reward trade off. As long term investors, we prefer definite returns over immediate returns and we don’t mind underperformance in the short term. We are happy to be a contrarian when the risk-reward payoff is compelling and don’t mind sitting on cash when we perceive weakness. Lastly, we are a very conscious of corporate governance and have zero tolerance towards governance issues.

Investment philosophy revolves around Carnelian PIU framework which involves deep dive into Business, Management and Risk Reward metrics.

The Fund allocated portfolio in 3 baskets –

Core lies within the magic basket followed by stable basket

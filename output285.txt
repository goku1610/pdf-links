The objective of the strategy is to generate long term capital appreciation for investors from a portfolio of equity & equity related securities. The investment strategy is to invest in companies and in sectors that are available at a significant discount to their intrinsic value and provide earnings visibility.

• The portfolio is comprised of 15-20 high-quality companies which are business leaders, have a strong management, low leverage and which offer a large margin of safety

• Investments pertain to largely in 2 – 4 high conviction sectors

• Identifying companies within the high conviction sectors that have attractive business models, strong balance sheets, good corporate governance practices and run by excellent management teams

• Significant Alpha Generation with Low Risk (Past portfolios have a beta of 0.7 – 0.8 which is lower than most mutual funds)

• Aims to target superior outperforming stocks over the benchmark through concentrated sector or stock positions where stocks are mostly held for the long term, typically almost always over 12 months.

IIFL Multi Cap PMS follows an interesting and insightful mechanism to dissect markets on exactly this mathematics i.e. corporate earnings. This is called SCDV framework, where by the whole of the listed market is divided on the basis of earnings profile of the companies, in following four quadrants.

• Seculars – PAT and ROE more than 15%
• Cyclicals – PAT more than 15%, ROE less than 15%
• Defensives – PAT less than 15%, ROE more than 15%
• Value Traps – Both PAT and ROE less than 15%

For investors chasing low risk – low return, seculars is the most ideal basket. It comprises of names like HDFC, Kotak, Bajaj, Asian Paints etc. But, if the idea is to strive for more, one needs to discover “those Outliers” in cyclicals, defensives and value traps which show a tendency of moving to seculars. This is where big alpha is made.

IIFL Multi Cap PMS follows a Core and Tactical Allocation where by 40% portfolio sits in Secular basket which becomes “Core” of the portfolio and remaining 50-60% is Tactical allocation between Cyclicals, Defensives and some amount to Value Traps. Core portfolio provides stability and tactical portfolio is where alpha is sought. The belief largely is that companies that are not in secular basket today will not always remain like that. There will be some outliers that over time will make a move to the secular basket in line with the improvement their earnings profile.

SCDV seeks to look out for these outliers in Cyclicals, Defensives and Value Traps. This is because when a company’s earnings profile improves, stock analysts rewards it with PE expansion and company thus commands a higher PE multiple. Likewise, there are case of PE contraction in line with fall in earnings profile. So, one cannot just invest in seculars of today and forget. One needs to follow a Core and a Tactical approach with a focus on reducing allocation to companies timely before the PE contraction and regularly discovering companies which could be up for PE expansion in the future.

As few examples of discovery of some of these outliers lately by IIFL Multi Cap PMS ( As of July 2019 )

• ICICI Bank, AXIS Banks were added to the portfolio when there was a pessimism around these banks because of NPAs and corporate governance. However, in line with NPA provisions decreasing, and new management coming, there was a hope for PE expansion.

The thought process in identifying ICICI & AXIS as outliers in cyclicals was based on the belief that decrease in NPA provisioning would lead to operating profits getting translated to earnings and change in management would address the corporate governance related perception, which would lead to PE expansion and higher PE multiple. The call worked well. What really triggered the change was “Increase in EBIDTA Margin. So, as earnings profile improved, market identified it with PE expansion.

• Merck Limited turned out to be an outlier in pharma, as it was quoting 20-21 PE i.e. 40% – 50% discount to MNC peers which trade at 30 – 40 PE. It was found, company had done Capex in last couple of years, which had suppressed the EBDITA margins, which was at 14-15%. Parent of Merck was selling India OTC business to P&G, which in India has 4 times bigger sales force as compared to Merck Limited.

There was a possibility of Increased Capacity of Merck Ltd getting benefited by Bigger Distribution capacity of P & G. So, it was likely that ROE would expand, and hence, company would command higher PE multiples. The call worked well. What really triggered the change was “Increase in EBIDTA Margin from 14%-15% to 22%-24%. Basically as earnings profile improved, market identified it with PE expansion.

• Aavas Financiers was bought when its IPO got listed. It was at the same time when, IL & FS default was unfolded. Aavas being an NBFC, was witnessing selling. All companies in NBFCs were looking weak, but everything cannot be painted with same ideology. Aavas which is backed by AU bank, was quoting at 2 times less price to book.

It had earnings growth of 35% – 40% plus, operates in the niche market of affordable housing. There is a huge demand for small home loans in small towns. NPAs which is main issue for housing finance was extremely low for Aavas. The call worked well. Stock doubled in less than 1 year.

• SBI was added at 185 and then at 230 when it was in a Value Trap. Whole philosophy was that SBI has the maximum NPA provisioning in the country and when NCLT money would be recovered, there would be improvement in earnings profile, and being the largest bank was not only available at a cheap price, but was expected to show improvements in earnings profile.
• Ultra Tech, a large cap stock in cement was added in Jan, 2019 when there was a belief that large caps are trading at expensive valuations, and stock actually delivered 30% in 8 months. The call worked well.

• RBL Bank was held in portfolio for 2.5 years. Allocation was 4%. First exit of around 2% was made at 640. The day the recent quarter numbers was announced, it was sensed that the guidance is negative and stock was thus, completely exited around 550. At present the stock trades as 375.

• Biocon was bought couple of years back. Beginning of July’19, allocation was 2.5%. There was a molecule launch expected which was supposed to benefit Biocon. We were holding Biocon for some time and were positive on it, but, 15 days before the launch of molecule by Biocon, its competitors in US launched the same molecule. When there is already a competition in the market, it leads to significant erosion of 25-30% in the products’ price.

We thus, sensed a concern that were going to play negative on the forward price to earnings, and thus exited the day this news came in US markets, and post exit the stocks has gone down further 15% to 20%.

Since inception, in last 4.5 years, IIFL Multi Cap PMS has thus delivered 18% IRR. During the same time Nifty has delivered 8% IRR, and BSE Top 200 has delivered approx.10% IRR.

In Last 1 Year, till 31st July’19, when terrain has been tough for all, IIFL Multi Cap PMS has delivered approx. 9.71%, vs Nifty’s returns of -2.71% and broader markets showing deep correction.

Simply put, IIFL Multi cap PMS follows Earnings, Earnings and only Earnings, it avoids value traps, stays away from corporate governance issues, and sticks to SCDV framework. This PMS offers an STP option as well, which helps investors to stagger their investments.

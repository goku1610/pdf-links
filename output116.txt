Red Flags

• Loose accounting policies
• Poor capital allocation
• Questionable founder history
• Related-party transactions
• Complex corporate structure (multiple subsidiaries, cross holdings)
• Corporate governance issues

The objective is to invest in high growth businesses with a potential to double earnings in 3-4 years and available at reasonable valuations.

Return ratios above 20% and debt-equity ratio under 0.5 are key attributes of SCP portfolio companies.

Since these attributes are difficult to find in large-cap businesses (either low growth or rich valuations), the market-cap focus remains in the 100th to 600th companies by market-cap rank.

Among the ~80 businesses bought so far in SageOne portfolios, more than 85% have delivered positive returns (and 65% have delivered returns above 25%).

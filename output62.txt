• A cap of 10% on individual stock at cost

We firmly believe that bottom-up, fundamental research offers the best way to identify high-quality companies with above-average, sustainable earnings growth.

• Fundamental Research:

The portfolio construction process begins with fundamental analysis performed by equity analyst(s), which provides the portfolio management team with company and industry research. Investment ideas are also developed by analysing company and industry information from meetings with the company managements, suppliers, users, competitors, industry consultants and broker research community.

• Research Process:

The equity research process typically begins with an industry/sector overview to identify industry trends and provide a framework for individual security selection. Fundamental analysis at this level usually involves analysis of unit growth prospects, pricing power, international growth opportunities, the regulatory environment, and economic sensitivity. Analyst(s) develop a robust knowledge of the economic, political and international situations that affect the industries under study.

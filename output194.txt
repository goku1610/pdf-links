To invest in fundametally strong companies for creating wealth over a longer period.

The portfolio follows a “Bottom-up, Stock specific approach.” After applying Care PMS proprietary quant screeners, the fund manager identifies companies which are growing in their business and trading at reasonable valuation. There is extensive fundamental research done and a detailed analysis is done of shortlisted stocks regarding its strategies, management execution capabilities, etc. The decision to add or replace a company is taken only after consensus among all 3 fund managers. The portfolio will be of 20 companies from 8-10 sectors from Top 250 companies by market cap. Also, 50% allocation is there towards NIFTY50 companies.
.

Care PMS Large & Midcap Strategy is based on fundamental analysis from investment basket of top 250 companies by marketcap. The strategy aimed towards building a portfolio of 18-20 companies with large businesses are growing consistently and run by professionals and highly owned by institutional investors. The strategy is aimed to deliver returns above benchmark i.e. BSE SENSEX with lower volatility.

An investor with a shorter investment horizon (3-5 years) and prefers lesser volatile portfolio can look at this strategy. Investors who are doing goal based investments for their short term goals like Luxury car, First Home, foreign trips, etc. can allocate funds to this strategy which can deliver better returns then fixed income instruments.

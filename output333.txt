Sameeksha Capital provides Wealth Management as well as Equity portfolio management (PMS) services to discerning Institutions, entrepreneurs, families and Individuals.  They have made upfront investments to develop best-in-class research capabilities and time tested processes. When a capable team follows such processes, they are likely to deliver differentiated as well as valuable outcomes for their clients. Transparency, Integrity, Objectivity and Hard Work are at core of their value system. Most importantly, they believe in being rewarded for performance above everything else.

The fund focus on process driven investing and have developed proprietary analytical models and methods which we follow rigorously to identify companies with superior risk-reward characteristics. A comprehensive set of rules guide us in our investment process and arguably reduce individual biases and mistakes.

Sameeksha PMS’s founder, Mr. Bhavin Shah, firmly believes that AI can help in navigating through data more easily, but cannot identify good companies fundamentally. So, although the team uses technology to increase efficiency of the research work or  study more companies in the same amount of time, the importance of reading beyond the lines of transcripts of conference calls is what AI cannot do, so, here comes the 140 point checklist & rules based investment approach that helps Sameeksha identify good investment opportunities at right valuations across large, mid & small cap universe.

Sameeksha follows market cap agnostic portfolio management approach with an aim to identify mis-priced large caps, and less researched small caps.

Sameeksha PMS follows a discipline of keeping right diversification with a limit on the number of stocks it holds. Also, Sameeksha PMS does not follow any model portfolio strategy, instead customizes each investors portfolio individually, which is managed well, because its in-house technology and softwares.

Like any other PMS, even Sameeksha Capital invests in businesses that have growth potential and with earnings predictability, and a clear understanding of business operations, valuation strategy applied, is what differentiates Sameeksha from others who follow growth at reasonable valuations (GARP).

Sameeksha Capital is cognizant that for large companies like HUL, it is okay to accept around 10% CAGR, but, if a higher risk is added by way of small-cap, illiquid companies, it is done on the premise of expecting a return of 20-25% CAGR.Sameeksha Capital PMS aims absolute returns and that means, if there is no investible company, it holds cash. And, it also means, that in the exceptional scenarios, where valuations look stretched, it books profits and aims to increase cash.  Keeping this in mind, Sameeksha avoids keeping too ill-liquid a portfolio.

Sameeksha Capital Equity PMS aims to amalgamate 4 core beliefs of Opportunity, Competence, Portfolio Discipline, and Values, to create concentrated fund of 15-25 businesses that:

• Will deliver growth based on end market and market share gain opportunities
• Have Clear and sustainable Competitive advantage in form of pricing power, cost structure, capital efficiency
• Are run by Competent Management with sufficient bandwidth and depth
• Follow conservative accounting practices and have taken sound capital allocation decisions
• Pass stringent corporate governance checklist
• Are likely to deliver sufficient ROIC as well as growth in revenue, earnings and cash flow
• Have relatively low dependence on capital markets
• Can deliver sufficient returns adjusted for risks and liquidity premium over a period of 3-5 years

A portion of the fund may be invested in companies that are turnaround situations or cyclical businesses available at discount to replacement value and these companies may not entirely meet the above criteria.

Portfolio risk for Sameeksha Capital Equity PMS is managed through diversification as well as through exits from over priced stocks Portfolio construction based on defined limits on individual position size as well as liquidity based exposure Focus on loss minimization and absolute return.

Sameeksha Capital Equity PMS has a flexible & valuable investment framework.

• Can take large cash positions or deploy other methods to reduce equity exposure in extreme market conditions
• Buy Sell framework also affects cash levels and sets up to end up at least in some cash when valuations are at extreme

Focus on Growth available at genuine value or pure value with a clear objective to generate target returns

• Buy only expected returns meet the risk adjusted hurdle rate
• Expected return based on very elaborate FCF or excess ROE model
• Do not stay invested if stock crosses the price objective

Alignment of Interests

• Additional Return allocation method is fair with concepts such as cumulative hurdle not commonly seen with other AIFs

(Fund Data)

(Fund Data)

(Fund Data)

Sameeksha capital was set up by our founder and fund manager, Bhavin Shah to manage his personal savings in an institutional setup. He directs all of his investments (which is more than 15% of the total AUM) in Indian equities through Sameeksha’s investment products and has no side pockets for investing in Indian equities reflecting significant alignment of interest b/w investors and fund managers. We’re sector agnostic bottom-up investors who follow rule based, process driven (140+ checklist), research heavy and technology backed approach. We invest in companies across market capitalization, have sustainable competitive advantage, are run by competent management and pass our stringent corporate governance checklist, among other things. We take active cash calls in market extremities since we’re flexible to increase cash position. This also coincides with our portfolio approach since we do not follow the model portfolio approach and have a buy-sell framework. This means that if new money comes in, we don’t just copy our current portfolio, we only enter if we’re comfortable at a particular price point. This in turn allows customization for each client portfolio.

We offer our services to institutional, family offices and high net worth investors. We count some very prominent and globally recognizable names as our valuable clients. We have grown primarily through word of mouth till date and predominantly from capital appreciation rather than fundraising. We always look forward to partnering with like-minded investors who understand our investment philosophy and would stay invested with us across extended time periods.  Clients investing with us across extended time periods have enjoyed meaningful alpha irrespective of the time of their entry.

We recommend PMS AIF WORLD, because, it is one unique platform that offers real knowledge driven investing with their highly meaningful data, reports, and content that is written very well. PMS AIF World is a team of highly articulate, educated, and experienced people.

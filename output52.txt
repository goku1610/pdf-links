Generate significant alpha and outperformance to benchmark by investing into a diversified sector agnostic multi cap portfolio of 25-30 listed companies in India with a higher allocation towards midcaps and small caps.

Adopt a more bottom up approach in identifying companies which meet our selection parameters from any sector. Have 40-50% allocation into stable earnings growth companies, have 20-30% into companies which can see significant P/E expansion and remaining 20-20% into companies which are deep value and have been beaten down owing to temporary negativity in the sector or company. Avoid structurally weak themes. Manage cash levels actively in the portfolio and keep booking profits from time to time.

Our investment philosophy involves looking for companies which meets the following criteria:

• Unquestionable management track record on ethics and execution capability

• Strong leadership position (among the top 3 players) in its domain and within the industry, with strong pricing power and not a ‘me too’ player

• Companies which have exponential growth potential leading to significant P/E re-rating possibility in future

• Strong cash flows and ability to pass through difficult times owing to strong balance sheet

• Manageable leverage in books lower than industry average

• Valuation comfort with enough margin of safety

ICICI Prudential Portfolio Management Services (PMS) enjoys a rich parentage of two large organizations ICICI Bank Ltd which is India’s largest private sector bank in addition to being one of the most trusted brands in financial services and Prudential Plc UK, an international financial services company, with significant operations in Asia, US and UK. ICICI Prudential PMS offers multiple portfolio options to cater to varied types of investor needs.

ICICI Prudential PMS Largecap Strategy is a diversified equity portfolio that endeavours to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing predominantly in largecap companies.

The Strategy seeks to achieve capital appreciation through investments in Indian companies or sectors with potential for growth. The Strategy aims to predominantly invest in companies that tend to grow earnings at a fast pace and are reasonably priced.

The Strategy aims to generate alpha by active sector rotation through a top-down approach. The top-down approach is used to identify key macroeconomic and sectoral themes, and subsequently to help identify stocks that are expected to benefit from the same. The Strategy intends to reduce concentration risk through diversification at the stock and sector levels. The Strategy seeks to invest in largecap companies with a proven track record, effective management and good growth potential.

Why Largecap Companies?

• These companies are usually market leaders in their industries having a strong & diversified customer base across a wide range of products allowing them to sustain in challenging times.
• These companies tend to enjoy the benefits of experienced management and usually have a long track record of performance.
• Largecap companies usually are fundamentally strong companies which are generally well capitalized having a lower debt to equity ratio along with sizeable cash reserves, access to credit and potential to withstand tougher times over the long term.
• Largecaps are considered to be relatively safer compared with other market cap stocks by way of low volatility.

Historically, largecaps have generally fallen by a lesser extent relative to the broader markets. Hence, Largecaps may turn out to be a relatively stable investment avenue in turbulent economic conditions.

The Strategy aims to follow a “buy and hold” approach. It aims to identify companies that offer reasonable potential for long-term growth.

• In 2023, ICICI Prudential PMS Contra Strategy was awarded as the Best PMS across all categories, on a 1Y Risk-Adjusted Returns. These Awards were hosted by PMS AIF WORLD, in association with IIM-Ahmedabad.

• In 2021, ICICI Prudential Long Short Fund, a Cat III Long Short AIF, was awarded as the Best AIF in the Cat III Long Short category, on a 2Y Absolute Returns basis. These Awards were hosted by PMS AIF WORLD, in association with IIM-Ahmedabad.

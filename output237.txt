At Buoyant, their aim is to generate superior cross cycle equity returns on a long term basis by optimizing portfolio based on market conditions.

The objective of Buoyant Capital Opportunities Multi-Cap PMS is to invest taking concentrated bets for the long term, following altering balance in the aggressiveness-to-defensiveness continuum, which is attained through diversification of cash flow streams, choice between predictable vs. growing cash flow streams and cash calls (pooled vs. model portfolio).

The team at Buoyant Capital Opportunities believes that one cannot know the ‘macro future’ (economies, markets or geopolitics) with any reasonable certainty.

Hence Buoyant PMS follows the following investment philosophies:

• Macros matter, but mining it as investment edge is nearly impossible
• Share price growth more a function of earnings growth

Portfolio optimization(balance of aggressiveness /defensiveness) is critical for Buoyant PMS
• In long-term, trading is a zero sum game
• In the short-term however, things fluctuate between ‘flawless’ to ‘hopeless’
• Balance is adjusted based on earnings / credit / investors’ psychology cycles

Risk is not volatility of returns
• It is (a) likelihood of permanent loss of capital and (b) opportunity risk

Creating wealth should be a source of pleasure
• Taking too much risk interferes with that, and that is why Buoyant PMS limits itself with respect to risks

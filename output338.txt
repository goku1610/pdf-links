Stallion Asset has only one PMS. The strategy name is Stallion Asset Core portfolio and it aims to create wealth by generating highest possible alpha for investors. Stallion PMS’ Founder, Mr. Amit Jeswani, believes that every bull run has leaders, and the leader of the previous bull run might not lead the next bull run and has a knack to find leaders for every bull runs.

Stallion Asset is a growth-oriented portfolio management company and the endeavour of Stallion PMS is to invest in the leader of bull run over every 1-3 year period. Leaders in bulls runs are created by strong earnings momentum. The Stallion Asset Core PMS aims to invest in companies that exhibit sustainable growth in earnings of close to 20% over the next 1-3 years.

The Stallion PMS has consistently performed and has been winning Awards for last 3 years (in 2020, 2021 and 2022) organised by us in association with IIM-A based on the format of risk adjusted returns.

Stallion Core portfolio has a consistent strategy of buying companies that fit the stringent criteria of Growth at a Reasonable Prices. The Stallion PMS follows 4-sector focused approach with a ‘Buy & Rotate’ Strategy. Stallion Asset PMS is a Multi cap PMS and Stallion Asset follows growth investing. Stallion PMS, prefers stocks that have hit 52 week highs rather than those that have hit 52 week lows.

The Stallion PMS portfolio construct is such that 40-60% weight is on Core Stocks, 40-60% weight is on Trends, and remaining is on Special Situations.

To put it in other words, Stallion PMS invests in 2 styles- one is to invest 40-60% in Proven Monopolies, and second, is to invest 40-60% in Emerging Monopolies.

Stallion Asset PMS focuses on the following 4 Ms:

Market Leadership

There is nothing worse than competition in business, Monopoly is the only condition of every very successful business.

Every Business starts with Solving a Problem! Every Big Business succeeds sustainably with making sure that it’sthe only one who can solve that problem.

Management

Two Key Roles – Capital Allocation & Capital Distribution.

Focus on Speed, Scale and Sustainability.

A Bad Person is a bad person & he will never make a good deal. This world is filled with Good people to do Business with. The Fair Value of a Promoter with no Integrity is 0.

Market Opportunity

The Size of Opportunity is the foundation on which large wealth creation lies, simply put it’s the size and duration of growth (of Earnings) of a business.

Stallion invests in companies that address a market which is large enough to allow our investment to grow 4-5x without needing to compete.

Margin of Safety

Value of the firm equals to steady-state value + future value creation + excess cash – debt.

Green Flags – Focus on following 4 sectors:

• Consumer
• Financials
• Consumer Tech
• Pharma

Red Flags – Avoid:

• Commodities
• Lead Bank Play
• Bad promoter valuation arbitrage
• Government businesses – G2B or B2B

Stallion Asset is a growth-oriented portfolio management company and the endeavour of Stallion PMS is to invest in the leader of bull run over every 1–3-year period. Leaders in bull runs are created by strong earnings momentum and Stallion Asset Core PMS aims to invest in companies that exhibit sustainable growth in earnings of close to 20% over the next 1-3 years. Stallion Asset portfolio is divided in 3 key parts:

Stallion believes that there is nothing worse than competition in business, Monopoly is the only condition of every very successful business. Emerging monopolies are high growth market leaders which are mostly consumer facing business models in the scale up stage. Proven monopolies are mature companies which are growing at 1.5-2x faster than nominal GDP and help outperform in both up and downcycles. Moonshot are a combination of special situations plus trends portfolio. These are mostly high alpha expectation stocks! With regards risk management, Stallion focuses on riding the winners and cutting the losers. Stallion PMS beta (risk) has been historically lower than the benchmark but returns (alpha) has been very strong. Stallion operates only one fund i.e., The STALLION ASSET CORE PMS which is a Multicap offering. This PMS follows 4-sector focused approach with a ‘Buy & Rotate’ Strategy. This PMS portfolio construct is such that 40-60% weight is on Core Stocks, 40-60% weight is on Trends, and remaining is on Special Situations.

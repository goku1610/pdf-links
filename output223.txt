Resilient Growth

The fundamental point here is to make sure that investing is focused on long-term wealth creation that is resilient to market ups & downs.

AlfAccurate Advisors invest in companies with superior earnings growth, driven by sustainable competitive advantage. They believe that in the long term, the market is a mirror of earnings growth and hence, consistent earnings growth is the primary drive of intrinsic value and stock price appreciation; thus, they focus on companies that have proven management teams, operating in a good growth market with a strong product portfolio.

Their strong leadership, focus on building a healthy, balanced portfolio of market-competing and market-creating strategic moves, innovation and agility gives companies a durable competitive advantage. That translates in producing resilient earnings growth, which when compounded, can deliver tremendous value to shareholders.

Resilient Fundamentals

The fundamental point here is to make sure that investing is biased towards companies with strong fundamentals that are resilient to economic shocks.

No one can influence the macroeconomic environment, but one must aim to ensure that the stocks held are the most resilient we can find. Guided by their 3M approach, AlfAccurate Advisors’ investment team focuses on selecting companies that have demonstrated strong business performance as evidenced by superior Return on Equity (ROE) and steady cash flows over the long term.

The aim is to invest in companies that possess sustainable competitive advantages, creating value as a profitable business that can, over time, provide attractive returns with less risk than the overall market.

Resilient Risk Management

The intent here is to ride the waves of volatility in a balanced manner.

Operational, technology and environmental stressors are nothing new in the investment world. What we are now seeing, however, is a higher frequency of failure, in tandem with the greater likelihood of a catastrophic incident. In response to these threats, the role of a risk-adjusted investment strategy as a line of defence requires a bedrock of radical resilience.

The key focus on diversification and a disciplined exit strategy helps them navigate uncharted waters such that we inherently mitigate market risks. Their strategy to respond quickly to change, helps to protect investors’ capital from market shocks and generate wealth over the long-term.

The investment philosophy at AlfAccurate Advisors is to make high-conviction investments in companies with strong moats and high growth potential that offer solid long-term, risk-adjusted returns for investors.

AAA or AlfAccurate Advisor’s proprietary 3M approach has delivered superior risk-adjusted returns year after year and resulted in various multi-baggers such as Hitachi, Motherson Sumi and Whirlpool over the past 11 years. They invest in companies that have proven management, a strong balance sheet, superior earnings growth and exceptional corporate governance. Their radically resilient strategy is in accordance with this 3M approach of Market Size, Market Share, and Margin of Safety.

• Market Size:

Market size determines the size of the opportunity. They prefer companies that are targeting a large market size to generate exponential returns.

• Market Share:

They buy companies that are the leaders in their sector as they are the best positioned to navigate the upturn and downturn of the economy.

• Margin of Safety:

Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. They buy the companies which are available at reasonable valuations.

AAA or AlfAccurate Advisors follow a 4-step investment process:

Stock Identification

• Identify sustainable competitive advantage

Portfolio Construction Monitoring & Nurturing

• Continuous portfolio monitoring ensures prudent risk management
• Regular interaction to provide strategic inputs to strengthen systems, controls and CG in line with best practices

Exiting & Realizing Value

• Constant evaluation of valuation metrics to decide optimum return potential
• Intrinsic value V/s Current Market Price to evaluate Margin of Safety
• Change in underlying assumptions of investment thesis.

AAA invests in companies that have proven management with superior earnings growth, driven by sustainable competitive advantage.

AlfAccurate Advisors believe that in the long term, the market is a mirror of earnings growth and hence, consistent earnings growth is the primary driver of intrinsic value and stock price appreciation.

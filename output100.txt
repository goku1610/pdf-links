To invest and create wealth with small and midcap sustainable high-growth companies for clients.

We intend to achieve capital appreciation by following a blend of value and growth investing. Our investment approach is to identify superior compounding growth stories that have the potential to deliver in the long run. We are always on the lookout for high-quality, resilient, relatively smaller players in their respective industries (like market leader, near market leader) who can grow even bigger in the coming future. We believe in safeguarding our client’s capital. If we are stumped on an investment plan, we rather prefer sitting on cash rather than risking a permanent loss of capital.

Moat’s investment philosophy is designed to identify superior compounding growth stories that can be delivered regularly rather than in bouts. Their investment approach keeps them fixated on our goal of picking premium quality businesses while safeguarding the client’s capital. They spot the undiscovered, hidden gems that can sustain a significantly higher Return on the capital employed (RoCE) compared to the Cost of capital (CoC) in the long run, freeing up the excess cash flow for the business. This phenomenon not only makes these businesses resilient but also sets them a class apart. In their view, these companies are deemed worthy of the title “premium quality business.” They remain fixated on the aim of long-term wealth generation for all clients. For this, they are on the constant hunt for companies that reinvest at least a portion of their excess cash flow back into the business to grow while increasing the returns for its shareholders. They stay committed to their investment picks for the long haul which gives the business time to create value and also allows them to reap the benefits of long-term compounding. Their investment approach solely looks for growth opportunities for businesses in their industries, irrespective of the size of the company or sector. They look for relatively smaller players in the industry that can become even bigger in the future. Their definition of small players also includes large-cap companies, the market leader, or even near market leaders if they are more than capable of further expansion and penetration in their respective industries.

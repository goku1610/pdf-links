Investment ideas are also developed by analysing company and industry information from meetings with the company managements, suppliers, users, competitors, industry consultants and broker research community.

• Research Process:

The equity research process typically begins with an industry/sector overview to identify industry trends and provide a framework for individual security selection. Fundamental analysis at this level usually involves analysis of unit growth prospects, pricing power, international growth opportunities, the regulatory environment, and economic sensitivity. Analyst(s) develop a robust knowledge of the economic, political and international situations that affect the industries under study.

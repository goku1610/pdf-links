The investment objective of Morningstar Investment Advisors Active GrowthPMS is to provide capital growth over the long term by investing predominantly in equity, debt and gold mutual funds domiciled in India.

The investment strategy of Morningstar Investment Advisors Active Growth PMS follows a multi-asset investment strategy by investing in asset classes such as domestic equity (55-85%), fixed income (0-30%), international equity (5-35%), gold (0-15%) and cash; based on Morningstar’s valuation-driven asset allocation approach. The universe of Investment Approach holdings includes direct plans of actively managed mutual funds and / or passively managed mutual funds domiciled in India, which are short-listed based on qualitative and quantitative assessment. The asset allocation of the Investment Approach is expected to change over time based on opportunities arising from changes in market valuations and views of the portfolio manager.

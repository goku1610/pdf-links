Girik Multicap Growth Equity Strategy focuses on creating wealth for investors over long term. Our philosophy is inspired by William O Neil’s CANSLIM style of investment management which primarily invests in leading, high quality businesses that can multiply in size over time with sound corporate governance. The strategy follows a disciplined approach to investing by using automated screeners along with a fundamental overview for superior outcomes. The portfolio construct is of 25-30 stocks with an investment horizon of 3-5 years. There is a robust risk management process with emphasis on capital protection that believes in cutting the losers and riding the winners.

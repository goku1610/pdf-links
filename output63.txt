The objective is long term wealth creation with lower volatility.

• Identify companies which create business value by actively innovating across products/processes.

• Stock selection and industry allocation independent of benchmark weights

• Around 50-75% of the portfolio will be invested in companies under innovation framework & balance in secular growth companies.

• Own high quality businesses with healthy Growth, ROE and cash flow profile

• A diversified multi cap portfolio with ~15-25 quality companies

• Derivatives exposures in the portfolio will be in line with SEBI guidelines and will be taken only for hedging purposes.

We firmly believe that bottom-up, fundamental research offers the best way to identify high-quality companies with above-average, sustainable earnings growth.

• Fundamental Research:

The portfolio construction process begins with fundamental analysis performed by equity analyst(s), which provides the portfolio management team with company and industry research. Investment ideas are also developed by analyzing company and industry information from meetings with the company managements, suppliers, users, competitors, industry consultants and broker research community.

• Research Process:

The equity research process typically begins with an industry/sector overview to identify industry trends and provide a framework for individual security selection. Fundamental analysis at this level usually involves analysis of unit growth prospects, pricing power, international growth opportunities, the regulatory environment, and economic sensitivity. Analyst(s) develop a robust knowledge of the economic, political and international situations that affect the industries under study.

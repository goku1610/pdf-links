Invest in quality businesses that are central to India growth story. Identify and participate in growth of these businesses over medium to long term. Practice Value Investing while making investment decisions.

• Invest in quality businesses that are core to India Growth Story and create the most value

• Portfolio of companies in industries with favourable operating dynamics – using value investing approach

• Stock selection and industry allocation independent of benchmark weights

• A diversified portfolio with ~25-30 quality companies

• A cap of 10% on individual stock at cost

• Derivatives exposures in the portfolio will be in line with SEBI guidelines and will be taken only for hedging purposes.

We firmly believe that bottom-up, fundamental research offers the best way to identify high-quality companies with above-average, sustainable earnings growth.

• Fundamental Research:

The portfolio construction process begins with fundamental analysis performed by equity analyst(s), which provides the portfolio management team with company and industry research. Investment ideas are also developed by analysing company and industry information from meetings with the company managements, suppliers, users, competitors, industry consultants and broker research community.

• Research Process:

The equity research process typically begins with an industry/sector overview to identify industry trends and provide a framework for individual security selection. Fundamental analysis at this level usually involves analysis of unit growth prospects, pricing power, international growth opportunities, the regulatory environment, and economic sensitivity. Analyst(s) develop a robust knowledge of the economic, political and international situations that affect the industries under study.

IndiaNivesh firmly believes that there are several small and micro-cap companies that are undiscovered and under-researched, having a robust and sustainable business model with tremendous growth potential and managed by dynamic entrepreneurs. These companies have the ability to generate significant wealth for their investors. Their idea is to build a cherry-picked portfolio of such companies for our clients, which is beyond the ordinary.

IndiaNivesh’s robust investment process includes a thorough quantitative screening of companies, which filters out the under-performing companies and highlights the winners. Companies are assessed across various parameters including financials, business sustainability and their competitive edge. This process encompasses a full due-diligence conducted by us. They also rigorously monitor the companies post-investment.

The portfolio strategy comprises: A streamlined and concentrated portfolio of 15-20 companies with an investment time horizon of 2-3 years. Fundamental analysis to pick only the best companies for investment using a bottom-up approach. Monitoring the companies to make decisions related to subsequent divestment or incremental exposure. Creating a disciplined approach based on valuations, long-term prospects and keeping in mind alternative prospects and opportunities.

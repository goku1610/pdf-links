To achieve steady, low volatility returns by investing across sectors and asset classes. The strategy is based on Tactical & Dynamic Asset Allocation. This replicates the India Super 50 Portfolio, with the additional overlay of multiple asset classes like fixed income, oil and gold. This ensures a high return profile, but with significantly low volatility.

A unique approach to investing, wherein Deep Data Science, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning are harnessed to unearth trends, patterns, in financial data (structured and unstructured), and then, our Human Intelligence applies its combined decades of experience to narrow down on a final list of stocks and asset classes, to invest in.

A Multi-Asset Allocation portfolio. This replicates the India Super 50 Portfolio for the equity allocation, but with an additional overlay of multiple asset classes like fixed income and gold and ensuring a high return profile, but with significantly low volatility. The portfolio uses FG ExoTech, our proprietary Human + Machine driven quantitative investment model that analyses and selects from a universe of 700 exchange traded Indian stocks that meet minimum market cap and liquidity criteria. The weights for each asset class are dynamically and tactically changed based on artificial intelligence inputs as well as First Global’s analytical tools. We firmly believe that Diversification, done right, delivers way in excess of market return, with lower risk.

Investors looking for a product that will help grow their hard-earned wealth with minimal risk and that is exactly what we offer. Our FG-IMAAP PMS scheme has a volatility which is the lowest when compared with the market and other PMS providers in the market.

We recommend PMS AIF WORLD, because, it is one unique platform that offers real knowledge driven investing with their highly meaningful data, reports, and content that is written very well. PMS AIF World is a team of highly articulate, educated, and experienced people.

Accuracap Alpha10 is one of PMS which has consistently beaten the Benchmark and most peer funds across cycles over a very long period. It is based on systematic model of investment that uses Fundamentals, Valuations and Technicals. Accuracap deploys a unique ranking algorithm that conducts extensive “Spatio-temporal” analysis of every business in their investment universe, by comparing it against every other business over space and time. Going by its stellar, decade long track record, one should expect long term outperformance relative to Market Benchmark as well as peers.

Investors who are looking to take exposure to large cap stocks with a view to beat the benchmark over long-term period from high-quality businesses with solid track record. These businesses tend to give larger returns than largecaps but also come with a little more volatility. So investors need to have a long term invest horizon of 3 years or higher.

We recommend PMS AIF WORLD, because, it is one unique platform that offers real knowledge driven investing with their highly meaningful data, reports, and content that is written very well. PMS AIF World is a team of highly articulate, educated, and experienced people.

This holistic framework offers a well-rounded and comprehensive approach to making informed and strategic investment decisions.

The investment strategy of the Carnelian YnG Strategy PMS – Carnelian Yield and Growth Strategy is designed around a carefully crafted portfolio aimed at delivering moderate earnings growth along with a reasonable dividend yield, while also providing a margin of safety against inflation. The strategy adheres to a “long only” approach within a multi-cap framework, ensuring a broad diversification across various sectors such as industrials, financials, and services.

The portfolio includes a mix of both public and private sector companies, aiming to strike a balance between yield and growth. Investors can expect a dividend yield of approximately 5% to 7%. Additionally, the strategy targets an earnings compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 12% to 13% over a three-year period, with a forward Price to Earnings (PE) ratio for FY24 projected to be between 10 to 11 times.

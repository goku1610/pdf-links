Investment Mindset of the Fund

• Growth + Value (Special Situations like Demergers & Delisting)
• Future Ready Businesses
• Importance to position sizing
• After all, the big money is made in Quality businesses only

Future Ready Businesses – Technology at The Fore

• Change is here. It is here at maximum velocity.
• Way of doing things is changing across the board
• Profit pools are shifting at an alarming pace from Traditional
• Businesses to Technology led Business Platforms
• Hence invest accordingly and pay respect to change and avoid old world ‘value traps’
• At Negen, they are closely trying to keep pace with innovation and try best to invest early in ‘Future Ready Platform Businesses’

Portfolio Refreshing

• Habit of refreshing the portfolio regularly so that it is never stuck in ‘value traps’ – stocks who’s time has long gone but investors feel it is cheap and good

Example: Covid made a lot of industries irrelevant while also created big opportunities for many industries. One of the big reasons for our big gains in June-August 2020 period is because we were quick to “Refresh” the portfolio and made it relevant to today’s realities.

Unlisted pre-IPO opportunities

In 2022, Negen Capital Special Situations & Technology Fund was awarded Rank#1 in the Best PMS across all Categories, on 1Y of Risk-Adjusted Returns. These Awards were hosted by PMS AIF WORLD, in association with IIM-Ahmedabad.

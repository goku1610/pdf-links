Upside AI Team has built machine learning products that can make fundamentally sound investing decisions. Upside AI’s algorithm teaches itself (a) what is a good company; and (b) what does the market consider a good company in current market conditions. Team at Upside AI, then manual checks on the governance and integrity before creating the portfolio.

Upside Multicap is market cap agnostic. Based on historical data, generally has high allocation (70%+) to small- and mid-caps. It will hold a diversified portfolio of ~10-25 companies. Target is to generate significant alpha while keeping risk at benchmark level.

Upside AI was founded on the belief that technology will make better investing decisions than humans over the long term. This is because machines are unbiased, unemotional and unaffected by market euphoria and panic. At Upside AI, we leverage machine learning tools while staying true to fundamental investing principles.

Upside AI relies on proactive system-driven decisions vs. reactive human-driven decisions:

Completely system driven decisions – no emotion, greed, fear, panic or human bias allows for generating superior returns while maintaining risks at market level.

The investment objective of Asit C Mehta’s ACE Midcap PMS is to generate long term return by investing in quality equity shares of listed mid cap companies.

The investment strategy of Asit C Mehta’s ACE Midcap PMS is to include the Investment Analytics, Portfolio Synthetics and an Investment Framework integrating the two. Investment Analytics focuses on developing analytical toolkits that can be used to best understand the known information. Portfolio Synthetics should be aimed at helping the portfolio survive and thrive in the always uncertain future. The future has some knowns, many unknowns and even more unknowable. A robust portfolio synthetics thought process understands that the portfolio should be designed to survive those unfavourable unknowns and thrive on the favourable unknowns.

The investment philosophy of Asit C Mehta’s ACE Midcap PMS is focused on a “Safety First” approach. The idea is that since one is operating in a risky asset class like equities, the focus should be on reducing those risks and chasing safety. Once all the ways in which one can lose capital permanently are understood and the ways of guarding against them are developed, then one can freely concentrate on enhancing returns and generating alpha without worrying about high risks, i.e., chances of losing capital permanently. Of course, the philosophy recognizes that any approach can only reduce the probability of permanent loss of capital but cannot make it impossible.

Marcellus Rising Giants PMS philosophy has its roots in the Marcellus’ Asset Managers Core Investment philosophy : –

Clean accounts and governance.

Strongly moated dominant companies in niche segments not yet well discovered by the market participants.

Strong track record of capital allocation with high reinvestment in the core business and continuous focus on adjacencies for growth.

At Marcellus, the Purpose is to make wealth creation simple and accessible by being trustworthy and transparent capital allocators.

The investment philosophy at Marcellus has evolved from the ideas of Kirby and Thiel, which they have refined further.

The investing approach has 3 pillars:

Clean Accounts: They have quantitative frameworks which use a combination of forensic accounting and capital allocation assessment define our investible universe.

Capital Allocation: They look for companies with superior track record of capital allocation – companies that generate free cash flows and reinvest them in the business to fuel further growth.

Competitive Advantage: The experienced investment team through in-depth primary research, constructs a portfolio of companies with deep competitive moats.

These companies are then held on for long periods of time with little or no churn, which allows them to capture the benefits of long-term compounding and deliver superior returns.

Marcellus Rising Giants PMS intends to identify and invest in high quality mid-sized companies (typically less than INR 75bn market-capitalisation, predominantly in the INR 7 to 75bn range).

High quality mid-sized companies have been amongst the biggest wealth creators in Indian equities over the last 3, 5 and 10 years.

From a universe of ~450 companies in this segment, a portfolio is constructed of 15-20 companies which make it past Marcellus’ proprietary forensic accounting & capital allocation filters as well as our bottom-up stock selection & position sizing framework.

• In 2021, Marcellus’ Consistent Compounders Portfolio or Marcellus CCP was awarded Rank #2 as the Best Newcomer PMS across all categories, on a 2Y Absolute Returns Basis. These Awards were hosted by PMS AIF WORLD, in association with IIM-Ahmedabad.

• In 2021, Marcellus’ Little Champs Portfolio or Marcellus LCP was awarded Rank #2 as the Best Newcomer PMS across all categories, on a 1Y Absolute Returns Basis. These Awards were hosted by PMS AIF WORLD, in association with IIM-Ahmedabad.

This PMS intends to invest primarily in high quality mid-sized companies (less than INR75,000 crores market-capitalisation, predominantly in the INR 7,000 crores – INR 75,000 crores range) with: 1) Well moated dominant franchises in niche segments; 2) A track record of prudent capital allocation with high reinvestment in the core business and continuous focus on adjacencies for growth; and 3) Clean accounts and impeccable corporate governance. Besides the earnings growth from market share consolidation in favour of Rising Giants companies and capital allocation initiatives of these companies, we also expect to benefit from free cash compounding as these operating profits of these companies grow faster than reinvestments (working capital and fixed assets investments).

An investor with a time horizon of 3-5 years who want to invest in high quality mid-cap companies with an expected long-term compounding of 20-25% should invest in this PMS

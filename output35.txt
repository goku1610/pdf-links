Founded in 2017, Upside AI is a SEBI registered PMS and currently manages assets for both domestic and foreign investors across a suite of products. The Company uses proprietory machine learning algorithms and combines it with fundamental company-level data and macro data.

Upside AI was founded by Atanuu (IIT Bombay), Kanika (CA/CFA), and Nikhil (IIT Bombay) who come with over 30 years of combined experience in financial markets (both US and India) and AI/ML technology.

Upside AI Top 250 PMS focuses on the top 250 companies in India by market cap. It will hold a diversified portfolio of ~15 to 20 companies and rebalance annually.

Upside AI looks to marry age old value/ growth investing principles with new age artificial intelligence. We have built machine learning products that can make fundamentally sound investing decisions.

Upside AI’s algorithm teaches itself (a) what is a good company; and (b) what does the market consider a good company in current market conditions. Team at Upside AI then does manual checks on governance and integrity before creating the portfolio.

Upside AI Top 250 PMS focuses on the top 250 companies (large and mid-caps) in India by market cap and creates a diversified portfolio of ~10 to 25 companies. Upside AI Top 250 PMS builds a stable, long term (annual rebalance) portfolio of quality stocks.

Upside Top 250 focuses on the top 250 companies (large- and mid-caps) in India by market cap and suggests a diversified portfolio of ~10-25 companies; builds a stable, long term (annual rebalance) portfolio of quality stocks. Focuses on top 250 stocks by market cap (large and mid-cap). Target is to generate alpha while keeping risk at benchmark level.

Upside AI was founded on the belief that technology will make better investing decisions than humans over the long term. This is because machines are unbiased, unemotional and unaffected by market euphoria and panic. At Upside AI, we leverage machine learning tools while staying true to fundamental investing principles.

Upside AI relies on proactive system-driven decisions vs. reactive human-driven decisions:

Completely system driven decisions – no emotion, greed, fear, panic or human bias allows for generating superior returns while maintaining risks at market level.

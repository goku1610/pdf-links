Ambit Emerging Giants PMS is a portfolio of companies that aims to create wealth over long periods of time by investing in the leaders of tomorrow, i.e. it is a small-cap oriented portfolio.

Smallcaps are largely undiscovered with low analyst coverage and lower liquidity resulting in valuation disconnect with fundamentals. Thus, the objective of Ambit Emerging Giants Portfolio is investing in the highly rewarding yet challenging world of small caps through their good & clean framework. In other words, it looks to identify the Coffee Can companies of tomorrow.

Ambit’s Emerging Giants portfolio aims to invest in small-cap companies with market-dominating franchises and a track record of clean accounting governance and capital allocation. The fund typically invests in companies with market caps less than Rs2,500cr. The stocks are screened through stringent quantitative filters and focus is on earnings growth + earnings quality.

Ambit Emerging Giants’ Portfolio selection process focuses on picking businesses with a good track record of efficient capital allocation and clean accounting practices, to pick the right investments. The aim is to build a low churn and concentrated portfolio of 15-20 companies, which can create wealth for investors in a relatively riskless fashion over a long time period.

Ambit Emerging Giants PMS looks to explore opportunities in the under-researched and under-owned world of small-caps, to deliver steady returns in what is traditionally perceived to be a high-risk investment.

The bigger idea is to identify small cap businesses, with strong leadership position in the micro or niche market that they are operating in. It not only gives them effective pricing power but help them gain in scale and become large companies of tomorrow.

Ambit’s Emerging Giants are LEADERS and WINNERS in growing industries:

Ambit Emerging Giants PMS’ ideology states that good risk adjusted returns is an outcome of Good Processes characterized by:
